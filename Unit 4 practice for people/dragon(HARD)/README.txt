Challenge Breakdown:


Dragon Attributes:

The dragon starts with health, energy, fire power, and other attributes. It needs to manage these carefully during actions.
Actions:

Fly: Reduces energy and increases fatigue.
Breathe Fire: Uses both energy and fire power.
Rest: Regenerates health and energy but cannot be done when fatigued.
Rage Mode:

When health drops below 20%, the dragon enters rage mode, which increases fire power but rapidly drains energy. Exiting this state requires healing.
Exhaustion:

After three consecutive actions, the dragon becomes exhausted and cannot perform further actions without rest.
Death:

The dragon dies if health reaches 0, and it cannot perform any actions once dead.
Hibernation Mode:

If both health and energy drop below 10%, the dragon enters hibernation, recovering slowly over time.
Action Log:

The dragon keeps a log of every action taken, allowing for testing of proper action sequences.
